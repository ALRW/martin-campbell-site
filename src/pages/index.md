### Who we are

Martin Campbell & Co was established in Richmond in 1980. It was one of the first local Borough agencies to specialise in all aspects of Commercial Property and has evolved into a niche consultancy practice

In 1990 the Kingston office was opened to widen Martin Campbell's area of influence in Kingston, Wimbledon, Esher, Surbiton and New Malden.

Our in-depth  local knowledge of these specific areas allows us to provide an unrivalled service to funds, property companies, private investors and tenants. Our areas of expertise include agency, acquisitions and disposals, investment and development, corporate strategy and professional services.
